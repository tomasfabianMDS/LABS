conjunto de datos, es importante mencionar que al analizar los datos, se identificó que las tres últimas columnas correspondían a las notas de los alumnos en matemáticas, escritura y lectura, respectivamente. Sin embargo, estas columnas no estaban configuradas como variables numéricas, a pesar de representar valores numéricos. Esta discrepancia ocasionaba que, al intentar identificar valores nulos en estas columnas, no se reconocieran como tales.\n","\n","Luego de corregir el tipo de datos de estas tres variables de 'object' a 'numeric', se pudo identificar correctamente los valores nulos. Se encontraron 40 valores nulos en la variable 'math score', 40 en 'reading score' y 47 en 'writing score'.\n","\n","Además, otra anomalía detectada fue la presencia de 247 filas con nombres duplicados, lo que sugiere que el conjunto de datos requiere una limpieza adicional para eliminar estas duplicaciones y garantizar la integridad de los datos.\n","\n","En último lugar, lo otro que llama la atención es que cuando se aplica la descripción numperica del dataset, al analizar las métricas que arroja este recuento estadístico simple, se observa que las 3 variables numéricas referentes a notas tienen como valor máximo un valor mayor a 100, lo cual es irracional para este caso.\n","\n","10.- Al analizar el boxplot proporcionado por nuestro compañero ChatGPT, se puede observar que en las tres variables numéricas (math score, reading score y writing score), el tercer cuartil comienza en el valor 100. Esto indica que aproximadamente el 25% de la muestra presenta valores de score para las tres materias mayores a 100.

observación del scatter plot revela una tendencia interesante: si bien las diferencias entre el nivel educativo de los padres de los alumnos no son siempre evidentes, se percibe una consolidación de los datos hacia la derecha a medida que aumenta el nivel educativo de los padres. Sin embargo, sorprendentemente, los alumnos con los promedios más altos no siempre provienen de hogares con padres con títulos de grado de master. Sin embargo, al observar específicamente a los alumnos cuyas calificaciones superan el umbral de aprobación, se nota una clara diferencia: a medida que desciende el nivel educativo de los padres, aumenta la proporción de alumnos con calificaciones insuficientes. En resumen, la hipótesis de que \"a mayor nivel educativo de los padres, mejores son las calificaciones de sus hijos\" se cumple solo de manera parcial, ya que existen otros factores que influyen en el rendimiento académico.\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jXrHFWBeg2TW"},"source":["## 4.
